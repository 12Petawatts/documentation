# Introduction

Welcome to the latest version of the Voron/Klipper setup documentation! These guides were created to help condense some "tribal" knowledge into a singular document that is easy to follow and navigate. The earlier versions were focused solely on the Voron 2 printer with SKR 1.3 control boards, but with the release of Voron 0 and new Voron 1 printers and the availability of other control board options, this guide has been split up into various modules so that it can be a single source that applies to many Voron printers. In addition, it has transitioned from a PDF format to hosted on Github with Markdown. This change is to allow easier updates and maintenance by you, the end user, if you find errors in the document. Feel free to suggest changes as you see fit!

Congratulations on making it this far, and I hope this document will help you!

-eddie, for the entire Voron community
